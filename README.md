Flood Area Segmentation using Satellite Images
This project focuses on flood area segmentation using satellite images to identify and map regions affected by floods. The segmentation process helps analyze flood-prone areas and supports disaster management efforts.

Key Features
Dataset: Satellite images sourced from [Kaggle].
Model: Deep learning-based segmentation using [ U-Net].
Tools: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib.
Preprocessing: Image resizing, augmentation, and normalization for model training.
Segmentation Output: Accurate detection and delineation of flood-affected regions.
Objectives
Automate the segmentation of flood-affected areas from satellite imagery.
Provide actionable insights for disaster response and urban planning.
Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing: Prepare satellite images for training and testing.
Model Training: Train a deep learning model for flood segmentation.
Evaluation: Assess the model's accuracy and segmentation quality.
Visualization: Display segmented outputs with overlays for better understanding.
Results
Visualized segmented areas using color-coded overlays for clear interpretation.
